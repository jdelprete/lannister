# Lannister

Lannister is a clone of [Oberlo](https://app.oberlo.com) written using Ruby on Rails. Oberlo is a web app used by [Aliexpress dropshippers](https://www.shopify.my/blog/117607173-the-definitive-guide-to-dropshipping-with-aliexpress).  It basically connects Shopify and Aliexpress, allowing you to import products, automate orders, gather stats, etc. Most of the frontend off this clone is just ripped off from Oberlo. The backend aims to mimic Oberlo's functionality with some improvements that I felt were useful.

Lannister can
* Import products from Aliexpress
* Automate order fulfillment
* Collect sales stats

Improvements on Oberlo
* Mix product variants from different Aliexpress products
* Select the right tracking company in Shopify when getting the tracking code for shipments
* Allows you to add Aliexpress affiliate tracking codes
